    <h1>HiFriends Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 10, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Welcome to HiFriends</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") are between you and HiFriends Inc. By using HiFriends, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. How HiFriends Works</h2>

    <h3>Core Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatic Delivery:</strong> When you take a photo, we use face recognition to automatically deliver it to everyone in the photo</li>
        <li><strong>Your Feed:</strong> Receive photos of yourself taken by others</li>
        <li><strong>Cascade Delete:</strong> Delete any photo of yourself from everywhere on HiFriends - your feed, photographer's camera roll, and everyone else's feed</li>
        <li><strong>Your Profile:</strong> Share selected photos publicly on your profile</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Coming Soon</h3>
    <p>We're constantly improving HiFriends. New features will be added regularly.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Your Account</h2>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be <strong>13 or older</strong></li>
        <li>Provide accurate information</li>
        <li>Keep your password secure</li>
        <li><strong>One account per person</strong> - Creating multiple accounts is prohibited</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Username Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your username must start with your actual first name</li>
        <li>You can add numbers or additional text after your first name</li>
        <li>This helps others identify who took their photos</li>
        <li>We may ask you to change your username if it doesn't follow this rule</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Face Recognition Setup</h3>
    <p>To use HiFriends, you must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete our face recognition setup</li>
        <li>Allow us to create face encodings from your photos</li>
        <li>Consent to receiving photos of yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Face recognition is required - it's how HiFriends works.</p>
    <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Face recognition is not 100% accurate. You may receive photos that aren't you (mark them "Not Me") or miss photos that are you. Accuracy improves over time.</p>
