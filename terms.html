<h1>HiFriends Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 10, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Welcome to HiFriends</h2>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") are between you and HiFriends Inc. By using HiFriends, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. How HiFriends Works</h2>

<h3>Core Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Automatic Delivery:</strong> When you take a photo, we use face recognition to automatically deliver it to everyone in the photo</li>
    <li><strong>Your Feed:</strong> Receive photos of yourself taken by others</li>
    <li><strong>Cascade Delete:</strong> Delete any photo of yourself from everywhere on HiFriends - your feed, photographer's camera roll, and everyone else's feed</li>
    <li><strong>Your Profile:</strong> Share selected photos publicly on your profile</li>
</ul>

<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
<p>We're constantly improving HiFriends. New features will be added regularly.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Your Account</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You must be <strong>13 or older</strong></li>
    <li>Provide accurate information</li>
    <li>Keep your password secure</li>
    <li><strong>One account per person</strong> - Creating multiple accounts is prohibited</li>
</ul>

<p>By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years old. If we discover you are under 13, we will immediately terminate your account and delete all associated data including biometric information.</p>

<h3>Username Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Your username must start with your actual first name</li>
    <li>You can add numbers or additional text after your first name</li>
    <li>This helps others identify who took their photos</li>
    <li>We may ask you to change your username if it doesn't follow this rule</li>
</ul>

<h3>Face Recognition Setup</h3>

<p>To use HiFriends, you must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Complete our face recognition setup</li>
    <li>Allow us to create face encodings from your photos</li>
    <li>Consent to receiving photos of yourself</li>
</ul>

<div class="important-box">
<p><strong>Biometric Consent:</strong> By completing face recognition setup, you provide informed written consent to the collection, storage, and use of your biometric identifiers (face geometry) for the purpose of photo delivery and identification on HiFriends. You may withdraw this consent at any time by deleting your account.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Face recognition is required - it's how HiFriends works.</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Face recognition is not 100% accurate. You may receive photos that aren't you (mark them "Not Me") or miss photos that are you. Accuracy improves over time.</p>

<h3>Photo Delivery Consent</h3>

<p>By using HiFriends, you consent to receiving photos of yourself taken by other HiFriends users. This may include users you don't know. You may delete any photo of yourself at any time using cascade delete.</p>

<h3>Block Users (Coming Soon)</h3>

<p>You will be able to block other users to prevent them from delivering photos to you or receiving photos you take of them.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Using HiFriends Responsibly</h2>
