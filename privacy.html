<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to HiFriends! This Privacy Policy explains how HiFriends Inc. ("we," "us") handles your information when you use our app.</p>

<p>By using HiFriends, you agree to this policy. If you don't agree, please don't use the app.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Account Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Name, email, username, password</li>
</ul>

<h3>Face Recognition Data</h3>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>During setup, we capture photos of your face</li>
    <li>We convert these into mathematical data (face encodings)</li>
    <li>We only keep the encodings to recognize you</li>
    <li>Original face photos captured during enrollment are not retained after encoding extraction</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Illinois residents:</strong> If you live in Illinois, you have special rights under BIPA law. We need your consent to collect face data, we'll never sell it, and you can delete it anytime.</p>

<h3>Face Recognition Technology</h3>

<p><strong>Accuracy Notice:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Face recognition is not 100% accurate</li>
    <li>Sometimes photos may be delivered to wrong people (false positives)</li>
